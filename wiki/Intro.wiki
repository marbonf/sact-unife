The design of the robot started from scratch with the aim to gain practical experience on mobile robotics, by addressing 
all the issues and learn all the lessons related to a full "mechatronic design".

Therefore, most of the mechanical and electronical parts of SaBot has been realized in the LIRA lab, including in particular the
motor controller called SACT (SaBot ACTuator control board).
