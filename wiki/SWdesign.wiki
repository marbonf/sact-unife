#summary Software Design of SACT firmware.

= Tasks and scheduling =

There are four cyclic tasks running in the SACT firmware.

  * *current control* loop: this task is the most frequent and the one with the highest priority. It is associated to the ADC
     Interrupt Service Routine, because the A/D conversion itself is triggered by the PWM timer and the end of its period. 
     Thanks to thed configuration of PWM pins with inverted polarity, this instant corresponds also to the peak value of the current
     feedback signal. This trick allows also to filter out implicitly the noise imposed by PWM switching of the H-Bridge power
     converter.
  * *velocity/position/cartesian* loops: this task is associated to the Timer5 Interrupt Service Routine.
  * *medium event handler*: this task is executed in a while(1) loop of the main() function, when a counter incremented by the
    PWM Interrupt Service Routine reaches a given value (corresponding to a period of 20 ms). Because of this execution method,
    the task is soft real-time (it can be interrupted by any Interrup Service Routine) and is related to non-critical operations,
    like commands management or board diagnostics.
  * *slow event hanlder*: this task is similare to the previous one, but it is executed with a period of 100 ms. It manages
    control mode switching (e.g. from OFF to TORQUE MODE) and the trasmission of diagnostic and sensor information packets on
    active communication channels.

The following paragraphs show the full call graphs of the four tasks, together with the parsing of commands received from a master
system.
